# Pengembangan-Aplikasi-Android-Intermediate-Story_App

Dicoding Android Intermediate Submission with MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture using SOLID (or atleast SOID principle)

Using Story API from Dicoding https://story-api.dicoding.dev/v1 and Google Maps functionality

The primary functions of this app are :
1. Users can upload photo then turn on their location of where the photo is taken directly via the phone's camera.
2. Users can upload photo via their own gallery, so it's not limited to the phone's main camera.
3. Users can change language.
4. Users can create accounts.
5. Users may be able to save the login authentication, so when the app is closed it's not obligated to login again, they are already logged-in automatically.
6. Users can logout from those said accounts.

This is the demo of the Application
