# Pengembangan-Aplikasi-Android-Intermediate-Story_App

This is my submission for Dicoding's Android Intermediate course, built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and Clean Architecture principles, incorporating the SOLID principles (or at least the SOID principle). The app is developed with Kotlin and XML views for Android.

The app integrates the Story API from Dicoding (Story API) and utilizes Google Maps functionality to enhance user experience.
Key Features

    Photo Upload with Location: Users can upload photos directly through the phone's camera, with the option to turn on location services to tag the location where the photo was taken.
    Gallery Photo Upload: Users are also able to upload photos from their device’s gallery, offering flexibility beyond just using the phone's camera.
    Language Support: The app allows users to switch between different languages, enhancing accessibility for a diverse user base.
    Account Creation: Users can easily create new accounts and manage their profiles within the app.
    Persistent Login: Once logged in, users can remain authenticated even after closing the app, thanks to a saved login authentication mechanism. This means they won’t need to log in again   unless they manually log out.
    Logout Functionality: Users can log out from their accounts whenever they choose, clearing the saved login credentials.

Technologies Used

    Kotlin for core app development.
    MVVM Architecture for a clear separation of concerns and ease of testability.
    Clean Architecture to keep the code modular, maintainable, and scalable.
    Google Maps API to enhance photo uploads with geolocation data.
    Story API to fetch and manage user stories within the app.
    SOLID Principles to ensure a clean and extendable codebase.

This app offers an intuitive and seamless experience for users to upload and share stories with geolocation, while also providing the convenience of persistent login and multi-language support
